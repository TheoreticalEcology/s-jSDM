## Version 0.2.0

### Submission 1

This is a new submission. 

The R package 'sjSDM' contains a scalable method to estimates joint Species Distribution Models (jSDMs) based on the multivariate probit model through Monte-Carlo approximation of the joint likelihood. The numerical approximation is based on 'PyTorch' and 'reticulate', and can be calculated on CPUs and GPUs alike.
