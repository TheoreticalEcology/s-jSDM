\usage{
plotsjSDMcoef(object, wrap_col = NULL, group = NULL, col = NULL, slist = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a model fitted by \code{\link{sjSDM}}}

\item{wrap_col}{Scales argument passed to wrap_col}

\item{group}{Define the taxonomic characteristics of a species, you need to provide a dataframe with column1 named “species” and column2 named “group”, default is NULL. For example, group[1,1]== "sp1", group[1,2]== "Mammal".}

\item{col}{Define colors for groups, default is NULL.}

\item{slist}{Select the species you want to plot, default is all, parameter is not supported yet.}
}
\description{
Plotting coeffects return by sjSDM model.
This function only for model fitted by linear, fitted by DNN is not yet supported.

\examples{
\donttest{
library(sjSDM)
# simulate community:
com = simulate_SDM(env = 6L, species = 7L, sites = 100L)

# fit model:
model = sjSDM(Y = com$response,env = com$env_weights, iter = 2L,se = TRUE) 

#create a group dataframe for plot
species=c("sp1","sp2","sp3","sp4","sp5","sp6","sp7")
group=c("mammal","bird","fish","fish","mammal","amphibian","amphibian")
group = data.frame(species=species,group=group)
