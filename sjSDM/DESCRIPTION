Description: A scalable method to estimates joint Species Distribution Models (jSDMs) based on 
    the multivariate probit model through Monte-Carlo approximation of the joint likelihood. 
    The numerical approximation is based on 'PyTorch' and 'reticulate', and can be calculated
    on CPUs and GPUs alike <https://github.com/TheoreticalEcology/s-jSDM>.
